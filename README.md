## Draft Q# code

The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). The VRP is an NP-hard problem that asks the following question: "Given a fleet of vehicles, a set of customers, and the distance between each pair of customers, what is the set of routes that minimizes the total distance traveled while satisfying the constraints such as vehicle capacity and customer delivery time windows?"

The problem can be formulated as an optimization problem where the objective is to minimize the total distance traveled. However, the objective function is not known in closed form and it is hard to optimize it using classical methods.
